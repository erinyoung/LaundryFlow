# LaundryFlow
Laundry with nextflow

This is meant to be a smaller, but complete training set of training materials inspired by those provided from [nf-core](https://github.com/nextflow-io/training) and course progression is highly inspired by the [circos tutorials](https://circos.ca/tutorials/lessons/).

Laundry is a common chore that could use many of the same concepts possible with Nextflow resource organization and management. 

Dirty clothes must be
- gathered
- divided by attributes such as color or soil-level
- washed
- dried
- folded

This is therefore a conceptual exersize with a visual dictionary to teach nextflow workflow usage.


If only laundry could be as easy as running a Nextflow workflow.

How to use this training:

Closing thoughts:
- resume
- reports and resource usage
- with-tower vs seqera platform
